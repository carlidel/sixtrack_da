    "For keeping my spaghetti code in one place with all the necessary scripts, classes and data structures, I built a small package over SixTrackLib and called \"sixtrackwrap\". It's meant for personal use only (i.e. it's partially undocumented and mostly not decent), but it does its dirty job and it's available on pypi."
